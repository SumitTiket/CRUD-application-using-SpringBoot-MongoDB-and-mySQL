This CRUD application is made with SpringBoot and Java which shows how Sql(mySQL) and Nosql(MongoDB) Databases work in coherence. Here the sql databse contains to information of students and MongoDB stores the course intormation, the end points are tested through postman. I tried to incorporate slight UI into it using React, but was getting few errors line (Protocol Error) so i'll may update that later on.
