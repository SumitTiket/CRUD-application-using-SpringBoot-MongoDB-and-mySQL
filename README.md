This CRUD application is made with SpringBoot and Java which shows how Sql(mySQL) and Nosql(MongoDB) Databases work in coherence. Here the sql database stores the student information and MongoDB stores the course intormation. The end points are tested through postman. I tried to incorporate slight UI into it using React, but was getting few errors like (Protocol Error.. etc) so i'll may incorporate that later on.
